## Why must you document your project?

- It doesn’t matter how good your software is; if the documentation is not good enough, people will not use it. Even if they have to use it, without good documentation, they won’t use it effectively or the way you’d like them to.
- THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE GLANCE AND LEAVE. Make it pretty so that it's easier for them to star before they leave. The more stars you have, the likelier it is that serious developers will use your repo.
- You will be using your code in 6 months. Code that you wrote 6 months ago is often indistinguishable from code that someone else has written.
- You want people to use your code because you think others might find it useful. However, people need to understand why your code might be useful for them before they decide to use it.
- You want people to help out. If you don’t have documentation, you will miss out on a whole class of contributors.
- You want to be a better writer.

## Best Practices

Things to remember:

- Keep a lighthearted friendly tone. Treat the reader as someone who doesn't have a lot of knowledge about the topic but is very interested.
- Keep things brief.
- Use headings frequently. This breaks things up when reading and often it is good for linking to specific information.
- Link to other places in the documentation often but only for additional information. Readers should not have to navigate through several pages to find information regarding one specific thing. Just inline the immediately relevant information and link off if they want to know more.
- Use as many code snippets, CLI, etc., examples as possible. Show the reader what you mean.
- Gently introduce a guide before diving into technical details. This gives context, and readers are more likely to stay engaged longer.
- It is always good to describe the functionality of the various files in your project.

Things you should avoid:

- Don't assume prior knowledge about the topic. If you want to appeal to a large audience, then you are going to have people with very diverse backgrounds.
- Don't use idioms. Write using more formal terms that are well defined. This makes it easier for non-native English speakers and for translations to be written.
- Don't clutter explanations with overly detailed examples.
- Don't use terms that are offensive to any group. There will never be a good reason to.
